## [0.11.1] - 2025-08-28

### Added

- Add support for DINOv2 linear semantic segmentation models. You can train them with
  `model="dinov2/vits14-linear"` in the `train_semantic_segmentation` command. Those
  models are trained with a linear head on top of a frozen backbone and are useful
  to evaluate the quality of pretrained DINOv2 models.
- Make fine-tune transform arguments configurable in the `train_semantic_segmentation`
  command. You can now use the `transform_args` argument like this
  ```python
  transform_args={
    "image_size": (448, 448), # (height, width)
    "normalize": {"mean": (0.0, 0.0, 0.0), "std": (0.5, 0.5, 0.5)}, # (r, g, b) channels
  }
  ```
  to customize the image augmentations used during training and validation. See the
  [semantic segmentation documentation](https://docs.lightly.ai/train/stable/semantic_segmentation.html#default-image-transform-arguments)
  for more information.
- Add support for the channel drop transform in the `train_semantic_segmentation` command.
- Add support for mapping multiple classes into a single class for semantic segmentation
  datasets. You can now use a dictionary in the `classes` entry of the
  `data` argument in the `train_semantic_segmentation` command like this:
  ```python
  data={
    "classes": {
      0: {"name": "background", "values": [0, 255]}, # Map classes 0 and 255 to class 0
      1: {"name": "class 1", "values": [1]},
      2: "class 2",  # Still supported. Equivalent to {"name": "class 2", "values": [2]}
    },
  }
  ```

### Fixed

- Models loaded with `load_model_from_checkpoint` are now automatically moved to the
  correct device.
- Loading EoMT models with `load_model_from_checkpoint` no longer raises a missing
  key error.
- Fix MLFlow logging on AzureML.

## [0.11.0] - 2025-08-15

🚀 **New DINOv3 Support:** Pretrain your own model with [distillation](https://docs.lightly.ai/train/stable/methods/distillation.html#methods-distillation-dinov3) from DINOv3 weights. Or fine-tune our SOTA [EoMT semantic segmentation model](https://docs.lightly.ai/train/stable/semantic_segmentation.html#semantic-segmentation-eomt-dinov3) with a DINOv3 backbone! 🚀

### Added

- Distillation now supports [DINOv3 pretrained weights](https://docs.lightly.ai/train/stable/methods/distillation.html#methods-distillation-dinov3) as teacher.
- Semantic Segmentation now supports [DINOv3 pretrained weights](https://docs.lightly.ai/train/stable/semantic_segmentation.html#semantic-segmentation-eomt-dinov3) as EoMT backbone.

### Changed

- LightlyTrain now infers the best number of epochs based on the chosen method, dataset size and batch size.

## [0.10.0] - 2025-08-04

🔥 **New: Train state-of-the-art semantic segmentation models** with our new
[**DINOv2 semantic segmentation**](https://docs.lightly.ai/train/stable/semantic_segmentation.html) fine-tuning method! 🔥

### Added

- DINOv2 semantic segmentation fine-tuning with the `train_semantic_segmentation` command.
  See the [semantic segmentation documentation](https://docs.lightly.ai/train/stable/semantic_segmentation.html)
  for more information.
- Support for image resolutions that are not a multiple of the patch size in DINOv2.

### Changed

- DINOv2 model names to be more consistent with the new naming scheme. The model name
  scheme changed from `dinov2_vit/vits14_pretrain` to `dinov2/vits14`. The pretrained
  weights are now always loaded by default, making the `pretrain` suffix redundant.
- DINOv2 models are now using registers by default which increases model performance.
  You can continue using models without registers with the `-noreg` suffix:
  `dinov2/vits14-noreg`.
- DINOv2 and distillation to work with image resolutions that are not a multiple of the
  patch size.
- Temporary files are now stored in the `~/.cache/lightly-train` directory be default.
  The location can be changed with the `LIGHTLY_TRAIN_CACHE_DIR` environment variable.

### Deprecated

- The `dinov2_vit/vits14_pretrain` model name is deprecated and will be removed in a
  future release. Use `dinov2/vits14` instead.

## [0.8.1] - 2025-06-23

### Added

- Add `student_freeze_backbone_epochs` option to DINOv2 method to control how many epochs
  the student backbone is frozen during training. We suggest setting it to 1 when
  starting from DINOv2 pretrained weights. See the [DINOv2 documentation](https://docs.lightly.ai/train/stable/methods/dinov2.html)
  for more information.
- Add channel drop transform.
- Add option to load multi-channel images with `LIGHTLY_TRAIN_IMAGE_MODE="UNCHANGED"`.

  for more information.
- Support for [Torchvision ShuffleNetV2 models](https://docs.lightly.ai/train/stable/models/torchvision.html).

  now highlights better how to use YOLO with LightlyTrain.

### Deprecated

- The `resume` parameter in the `train` command is deprecated in favor of
  `resume_interrupted` and will be removed in a future release. The new parameter
  behaves the same as the old one but is more explicit about its purpose. See
  [the documentation](https://docs.lightly.ai/train/stable/train/index.html#resume-training)
  for more information.
