# Distillation (recommended 🚀)

Knowledge distillation involves transferring knowledge from a large, compute-intensive teacher model to a smaller, efficient student model by encouraging similarity between the student and teacher representations. It addresses the challenge of bridging the gap between state-of-the-art large-scale vision models and smaller, more computationally efficient models suitable for practical applications.

```{note}
Starting from **LightlyTrain 0.7.0**, `method="distillation"` uses a new, improved `v2` implementation
that achieves higher accuracy and trains up to 3x faster. The previous version is still available via
`method="distillationv1"` for backward compatibility.
```

## Use Distillation in LightlyTrain

Follow the code below to distill the knowledge of the default DINOv2 ViT-B/14 teacher model into your model architecture. The example uses a `torchvision/resnet18` model as the student:

````{tab} Python
```python
import lightly_train

if __name__ == "__main__":
    lightly_train.train(
        out="out/my_experiment", 
        data="my_data_dir",
        model="torchvision/resnet18",
        method="distillation",
    )
```
````

````{tab} Command Line
```bash
lightly-train train out=out/my_experiment data=my_data_dir model="torchvision/resnet18" method="distillation"
```
````

### 🔥 Distill from DINOv3 🔥

To distill from DINOv3 you have to set the `teacher` argument in `method_args` to one of
the [supported models](#methods-distillation-supported-models).

```{note}
DINOv3 models are released under the [DINOv3 license](https://github.com/lightly-ai/lightly-train/blob/main/licences/DINOv3_LICENSE.md).
```

````{tab} Python
```python
import lightly_train

if __name__ == "__main__":
    lightly_train.train(
        out="out/my_experiment", 
        data="my_data_dir",
        model="torchvision/resnet18",
        method="distillationv1",
        method_args={
            "teacher": "dinov3/vitb16",
        }
    )
```

### Pretrain and Distill Your Own DINOv2 Weights

LightlyTrain also supports [DINOv2 pretraining](#methods-dinov2), which can help you adjust the DINOv2 weights to your own domain data. Starting from **LightlyTrain 0.9.0**, after pretraining a ViT with DINOv2, you can distill your own pretrained model to your target model architecture with the distillation method. This is done by setting an optional `teacher_weights` argument in `method_args`.

The following example shows how to pretrain a ViT-B/14 model with DINOv2 and then distill the pretrained model to a ResNet-18 student model. Check out the [DINOv2 pretraining documentation](#methods-dinov2) for more details on how to pretrain a DINOv2 model.

````{tab} Python
```python
import lightly_train

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Pretrain a DINOv2 ViT-B/14 model.
    lightly_train.train(
        out="out/my_dinov2_pretrain_experiment",
        data="my_dinov2_pretrain_data_dir",
        model="dinov2/vitb14",
        method="dinov2",
    )

    # Distill the pretrained DINOv2 model to a ResNet-18 student model.
    lightly_train.train(
        out="out/my_distillation_pretrain_experiment",
        data="my_distillation_pretrain_data_dir",
        model="torchvision/resnet18",
        method="distillation",
        method_args={
            "teacher": "dinov2/vitb14",
            "teacher_weights": "out/my_dinov2_pretrain_experiment/exported_models/exported_last.pt", # pretrained `dinov2/vitb14` weights 
        }
    )
```

## What's under the Hood

Our distillation method directly applies a mean squared error (MSE) loss between the features of the student and teacher networks when processing the same image. We use a ViT-B/14 backbone from [DINOv2](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.07193) as the teacher model. Inspired by [*Knowledge Distillation: A Good Teacher is Patient and Consistent*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.05237), we apply strong, identical augmentations to both teacher and student inputs to ensure consistency of the objective.

## Lightly Recommendations

- **Models**: Knowledge distillation is agnostic to the choice of student backbone networks.
- **Batch Size**: We recommend somewhere between 128 and 2048 for knowledge distillation.
- **Number of Epochs**: We recommend somewhere between 100 and 3000. However, distillation benefits from longer schedules and models still improve after training for more than 3000 epochs. For small datasets (\<100k images) it can also be beneficial to train up to 10000 epochs.
